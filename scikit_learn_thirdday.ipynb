        "Scikit-learn (sklearn):\n",
        "scikit-learn, commonly known as sklearn, is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, making it a valuable resource for machine learning tasks. sklearn is built on top of other scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, and it integrates well with the broader Python ecosystem.\n",

        "Key Features and Capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine Learning Algorithms: sklearn offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. Some popular algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Preprocessing: The library provides various tools for data preprocessing, including feature scaling, imputation of missing values, data normalization, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection and Evaluation: sklearn offers tools for model selection, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, to ensure the best performance of machine learning models. It also provides metrics for evaluating model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipeline: sklearn allows users to create data processing and model building pipelines, streamlining the process of training and testing machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integration with Pandas: It integrates well with Pandas, a popular data manipulation library in Python, making it convenient to work with structured datasets.\n",
